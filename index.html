                <p class="wrap-text">My name is Sydney Preston and I am from Olympia Washington, but I’ve lived in several other states throughout my life. 
                    I was raised by my mother and in sixth grade we made our first big move to the outskirts of Chicago. 
                    We stayed in Chicago for a year and a half before moving to Raleigh, North Carolina. 
                    After graduating high school, I got accepted to the University of Minnesota and moved to Minneapolis; where I studied photography and graduated in 2016 with a fine arts degree.</p>
            
            
                <p class="wrap-text">In 2017 I decided to make a big life change and move to Colorado. Before I moved, I was working as a design engineer at a printing company. 
                    It wasn’t the job for me, so I decided to take a step back and figure out what I wanted to do. 
                    I began working at Starbucks and I have since worked my way up from Barista to Shift Supervisor. 
                    I still work at Starbucks, but I have moved my focus to learning web development so that I can make a career change. 
                    Hopefully by next summer I can begin a new career in the tech industry.</p>
            
                
                <p class="wrap-text">Since moving to Colorado, I have experienced a lot of growth in my personal life as well as finding a career path I’d like to pursue.
                    After moving I began my journey of aerial dance and aerial performance. 
                    I found a studio that has become such an important part of my life and I can’t imagine life without all my aerial friends. 
                    In my free time I enjoy aerial dance, performing, snowboarding, hiking, listening to live music, and enjoying time with friends. 
                    I am excited to continue pursuing aerial dance in my freetime as well as to see where this new career path will take me! </p>
